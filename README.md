This is all on my notes learning python programming..

************************Quiz app****************************
My task is to create a quiz app that will display the result of correct and wrong answers.
Thing I want to add in this project are:
1: Pull the questions and answer from the file. 
2: pull question with images if they have.
3: I should be able to pick how many questions I want to take test on like 10,20,30â€¦100 or all 
4: I want to display the wrong and right answer for wrong answers and just correct for right answer in html/webpage/send window in this program.
5: I want to create the button that will display the wrong and right answer for wrong answers and just correct for right answer in same window where i will choose answers.
